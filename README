Discord protocol plugin for bitlbee.

Build dependencies
------------------
- bitlbee and headers
  If using distribution version of bitlbee you will need to install the dev
  package, usually bitlbee-dev or bitlbee-devel. If bitlbee was built from
  source don't forget to do `make install-dev`.

- libwebsockets >= 1.5 and headers (https://libwebsockets.org)
  Archlinux users can use libwebsocket-git from AUR, others are out of luck and
  will have to build it from source for now, debian's version in sid is too old
  (1.2), fedora23 doesn't provide this package at all.

Building and Installing
-----------------------
The process is extremely dumb for now, so it is just:

  $ make && sudo make install

This will build the discord.so file and put it into /usr/lib/bitlbee directory,
if your bitlbee's plugindir is somewhere else you'll have to move it manually.

Usage
-----
Plugint adds 'discord' protocol to bitlbee, add your account as usual:

  > account add discord <email> <password>
  > account discord on

Options
-------
This section describes options available throug "account set" bitlbee command
(for help on usage of this command see "help account set").

  - host (type: string; default: discordapp.com)
    Discord server hostname. Just in case discord changes the hostname or there
    are some alternatives with compatible API.

  - voice_status_notify (type: boolean; default: no)
    This enables text notifications in your control channel about users
    changing/leaving voice channels. Can be noisy on big servers.

Bugs

Plugin is in early development stages, so there should be plenty, please report
